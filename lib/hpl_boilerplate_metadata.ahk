background := "This film reel contains short segments on news events in the Channel 11 viewing area, mostly within the city of Houston. The segments were filmed prior to the news show, and the anchorperson would have provided a voice-over describing the action and highlights of the news story. Each reel contains a series of film clips literally spliced together end-to-end without the benefit of the transitional commentary supplied by the anchor. This format eliminates introductory summaries as well as entire news stories narrated live by the anchor during a broadcast. Neither the sound track or the film visual contain on-camera anchor material. The titles that have been assigned to each film clip were created by people working at KHOU-TV, probably the camera operators or editors."
